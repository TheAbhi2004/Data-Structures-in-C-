# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures Lab Programs â€“ 3rd Semester

This repository contains all the **Data Structures (DS)** programs completed as part of the DS Lab in my 3rd semester of B.Tech in Information Technology. The course was taught by **Mr. Arup Abhinna Acharya**, who explained all the concepts clearly and practically.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

The lab covered a wide range of core data structures and their operations, implemented in C/C++:

### ðŸ“Œ Arrays
- Basic operations: insertion, deletion, traversal
- Searching: Linear & Binary Search
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort

### ðŸ“Œ Strings
- String manipulation (length, copy, reverse)
- Palindrome check
- String pattern matching (NaÃ¯ve and KMP)

### ðŸ“Œ Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List: insert, delete, traverse
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Reversing a linked list

### ðŸ“Œ Stacks
- Stack using arrays
- Stack using linked lists
- Applications: Infix to Postfix, Postfix Evaluation

### ðŸ“Œ Queues
- Linear Queue using arrays
- Circular Queue
- Queue using linked list
- Deque (Double Ended Queue)
- Priority Queue

### ðŸ“Œ Trees
- Binary Tree creation and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
- Binary Search Tree (BST): insertion, deletion, searching
- Height, count, and depth of nodes

### ðŸ“Œ Graphs
- Representation: Adjacency Matrix & List
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- DFS (Depth-First Search)

### ðŸ“Œ Miscellaneous
- Recursion-based programs
- Time & Space complexity insights for each implementation
